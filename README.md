# A Fizz Buzz example that keeps a count of instances using a state monad

The simple Fizz Buzz coding exercise but with a twist.
In this version, we also return a count of the instances of Fizz, Buzz and FizzBuzz as well as the number of Integers in the resulting string.
This is done cleanly and functionally using a state monad to avoid side effects.
